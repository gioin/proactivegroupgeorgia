                GAMING and future plans goes here. Call of Duty is a
                first-person shooter video game franchise published by
                Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set
                in World War II. Over time, the series has seen games set in the
                midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. The
                games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by
                Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld
                games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call
                of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, was released on November 13, 2020.
                For four months I was interning at the South Caucasus Regional Office of the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Tbilisi. Since my time at the Foundation began early in the year, my first and main task consisted of summarizing and evaluating all projects from the passed year in order to draft an annual report for the BMZ in Germany. Writing this report right in the beginning of my internship gave me a good overview of the great variety of projects implemented by the HBF SC.
